# Postgres Driver from Scratch (Node.js)

**Work In Progress**

---

## Overview

This project is a PostgreSQL driver for Node.js, written entirely from scratch.  
It aims to provide a minimal, transparent, and educational implementation of the PostgreSQL wire protocol, allowing Node.js applications to connect to and interact with a PostgreSQL database without relying on existing libraries.
